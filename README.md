# Ellie's Personal NERP Stack Boilerplate

This is my personal boilerplate for a NERP stack web app. 

+ `npm i` to install dependencies
+ `npm run start:backend` to start server on port 3000
+ `npm run start:frontend` to compile and build frontend
+ If you need to seed data, write your data out in /seed/seed.js and run "npm seed" in the terminal.
+ There is no implementation of redux or react-redux, however, they're installed as node modules if you want to implement it on the front-end
